## Scripts
This scripts help you saving time with the detection of silences (with ffmpeg) for each video/lesson.

* On **Linux**: use ``silences.sh``. Note: before running it, make it sure it has all permissions granted.
* On **Windows**: use ``silences.bat``. Note: you need the binary file ``ffmpeg.exe`` ([you can find it here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)) downloaded in the same folder of the script. Also, on the first run your antivirus may deny the execution of the script.

For **Mac OS** users: I'm sorry I can't write a script for this OS. Feel free to write it down and open a pull request.
