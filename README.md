## Getting started

### Install
  * Download, install and run [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html);
  * Open xampp folder:
    * On Linux: ``/opt/lampp/htdocs/``
    * On Windows: ``C:\\xampp\htdocs\``
    * On Mac: mount Xampp volume and open the folder ``htdocs``
  * Create a new folder (e.g.: ``lesson-player/``) and copy all files inside;
  * Open the browser at ``http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`` and create a new database (e.g.: ``lessons``);
  * From the xampp folder, open ``_connect.php`` and update the database credentials (and maybe the language);
  * From the browser go to ``http://localhost/<folder_name>/install.php`` (e.g.: ``http://localhost/lesson-player/install.php``);
  * (Optional) Make xampp run at pc startup by default.

### Add video lessons
  * In the folder ``.../htdocs/lesson-player/`` create a subdirectory (e.g.: ``classes/``) and copy all your video lessons inside, arranged in a structure like:

```
    lesson-player/
        classes/
            Physics I/
                Lesson 01.mp4
                Lesson 02.mp4
                ...
            Chemistry/
                Lesson 2021-01-01.mp4
                Lesson 2021-01-02.mp4
                ...
            ...
```

  * Note: folders and videos inside ``classes`` may also be links.
  * Open the browser at ``http://localhost/lesson-player/``;
  * Insert all your classes: name, professor, folder name (e.g.: ``classes/Physics I/``, notice the ``/`` at the end);
  * Go back to the homepage:
    * Select a class and press ``Show`` (_``Mostra`` in italian_);
    * Insert all lessons of the selected class: date of the lesson, title, file name (e.g.: ``Lesson 01.mp4``);

### Speed up silences
For each lesson it's possible to find and speed up silences, using ``ffmpeg``:
  * Download and install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/);
  * Open the terminal (or prompt);
  * Move to the folder ``.../lesson-player/`` (e.g. using ``cd <xampp_folder>/htdocs/lesson-player/``);
  * Run ffmpeg with ``silencedetect`` filter, as shown in the form of creation/edit of a lesson. E.g.:

```
    ffmpeg -hide_banner -nostats -vn -i "classes/Physics I/Lesson 01.mp4" -af silencedetect=n=0.002:d=2.3 -f null -
```

  * Copy & paste the output in the form of creation/edit of the lesson. Example of a ffmpeg output:

```
    ...
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_start: 8.58428
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_end: 17.2754 | silence_duration: 8.69112
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_start: 2765.06
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_end: 2768.73 | silence_duration: 3.66969
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_start: 3653.35
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_end: 3657.01 | silence_duration: 3.66175
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_start: 4347.37
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_end: 4349.95 | silence_duration: 2.58562
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_start: 4424.87
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_end: 4429.57 | silence_duration: 4.69538
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_start: 4475.08
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_end: 4478.69 | silence_duration: 3.61456
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_start: 4961.04
    [silencedetect @ 0x56093ac71400] silence_end: 4965.18 | silence_duration: 4.14791
    ...
```

  * You can also edit the filter, but in order to ensure the success of the program, the minimum duration of silences (``d``) must be > 2.25. [Why?](#why-the-minimum-silence-duration-should-be-greater-than-225s)

With the aim of saving time, I've written a little [script in *bash*](https://github.com/padvincenzo/lesson-player/blob/main/scripts/silences.sh) and another one [in *batch*](https://github.com/padvincenzo/lesson-player/blob/main/scripts/silences.bat). They both run the filter on every video in the same folder where the script is executed, and save the result in a file with the same name of the video (so the script should be executed in the folder that contains the videos).

## FAQ

#### Why the minimum silence duration should be greater than 2.25s
At *8x* speed, preset for silences, the video time updates every about *2s*. To work around this problem, when you load the silence times that ffmpeg generates, the server removes a *2s* margin from the end of the silence, and adds *0.25s* from the beginning. By setting a duration ``d`` less than *2.25s*, the server will recognize these silences with a duration ``(d - 2.25) â‰¤ 0``, therefore they will be ignored. You can change these margins from ``/ajax/lesson.php``, inside the ``insertSilences()`` function (``$marginLeft`` and ``$marginRight`` variables), but this could cause unwanted effects.

```php
function insertSilences() {
  /* ... */

  $marginLeft = 0.25; // Seconds after silence starts
  $marginRight = 2;   // Seconds before silence ends

  /* ... */
}
```

#### I want even the shortest silences to be recognized and speeded up, what can I do?
Unfortunately, this is not possible without re-encoding the video itself. Thinking about this, I developed another program: [silence-speedup](https://github.com/padvincenzo/silence-speedup). I hope it will be useful to you.

#### I want to change the minimum/maximum/silence playback rate, how can I do?
Open the file ``/js/player.js`` and edit the followings:

```js
class Player {
  /* ... */

  static fastPlaybackRate = 8;  // Playback rate on silences
  static minPlaybackRate = 0.5; // Slower playback rate
  static maxPlaybackRate = 3;   // Faster playback rate

  /* ... */
}
```

Then reload the page.
